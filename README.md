## Why Termy?

Termy is built for people who already live in Obsidian and do real work in a terminal. It is designed as more than a terminal pane: it provides a workflow-oriented terminal environment that stays aligned with your vault, editor context, and AI coding sessions.

- **Native PTY backend**: Rust keeps the backend lean and avoids extra bridge runtimes.
- **Real terminal UX**: xterm.js frontend with search, copy/paste, prompt navigation, split panes, and multi-session support.
- **Workflow-driven automation**: Run reusable terminal, Obsidian-command, and external-link workflows from the status bar or command palette.
- **File-aware interactions**: Drag text, files, and folders into the terminal and open file references directly from terminal output.
- **AI-aware context handoff**: Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode integrations can inherit active note context from Obsidian.
- **Desktop-first customization**: Shell selection, tab/split placement rules, theme sync, background images, blur, renderer controls, and Windows input handling.

## Features

### Terminal Workspace

- Run local shells directly inside Obsidian on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Use `cmd`, PowerShell, PowerShell Core, WSL, Git Bash, `bash`, `zsh`, or a custom shell path.
- Open terminals in the current tab, a new tab, left/right tab groups, horizontal/vertical splits, or a new window.
- Search terminal output, clear screen or buffer, resize fonts, navigate prompts, and copy/paste normally.
- Keep new terminals near existing terminal tabs, focus them automatically, or pin them on creation.

### Workflows & Launchers

- Create preset workflows with one or more ordered actions.
- Combine terminal commands, Obsidian commands, and external links in a single workflow.
- Launch workflows from the status bar menu, command palette, or built-in workflow commands.
- Decide whether each workflow appears in the status bar, opens a terminal, starts a fresh terminal instance, or renames the target tab.
- Start quickly with built-in launchers for Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI.

### Obsidian Interactions

- Send the current editor selection, full note, or active note path into the active terminal.
- Drag text, files, and folders into the terminal to paste content or resolved paths.
- Click file references printed by tools, agents, scripts, or compilers to reopen matching vault files or external paths.
- Open the bundled changelog from the command palette or settings.

### AI & Coding Integrations

> [!NOTE]
> Claude Code, OpenCode, or Codex sessions started from an external terminal are ordinary CLI processes outside Termy's Obsidian integration layer, so they cannot automatically know the active note, vault/workspace root, or editor selection.

- Termy starts AI CLIs inside the current vault context, where the active note, selection, open files, and workspace root can be available to coding tasks.
- Claude Code and OpenCode use Termy's IDE bridge; Codex uses a vault-local Skill at `.agents/skills/termy-obsidian-context/SKILL.md`.
- The built-in Codex launcher starts `codex` directly, without MCP registration or global CLI configuration changes.

### Privacy and Network Access

- Termy does not include telemetry or analytics.
- Termy downloads the matching native PTY server binary when needed. The default source is `https://termy.changqiu.xyz`; GitHub Releases can be selected in settings, and offline mode disables automatic download/update checks.
- Terminal sessions run local shell commands and user-configured workflows. Those commands may read files, modify files, or access the network according to the shell command or external CLI being run.
- Termy starts local WebSocket connections for its PTY backend and optional IDE bridge. These connections are used for local terminal transport and editor-context handoff.
- Context-aware AI launchers can pass the active note path, selection, editor context, and vault/workspace path to local CLI tools. The Codex integration writes a vault-local helper skill under `.agents/skills/termy-obsidian-context/`.
- Optional: when **Check for AI launcher updates** is enabled in settings, Termy queries `https://registry.npmjs.org` for the latest Claude Code and Codex CLI releases, and `https://api.github.com` for the latest OpenCode release. The setting is **off by default** and offline mode disables it regardless of the toggle.

### Appearance & Ergonomics

- Follow the Obsidian theme or use custom foreground and background colors.
- Choose Canvas or WebGL rendering, with automatic Canvas fallback when background images are enabled.
- Configure background image URL/path, opacity, size, position, blur amount, and text opacity.
- Use localized UI in English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian.
- Tune Windows-friendly input behavior with `win32-input-mode` support for shells that depend on native key events.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Obsidian Desktop
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

> [!WARNING]
> Termy is desktop-only because it uses a native PTY backend.

### Install from the Obsidian Community Plugins (recommended)

Termy is now listed in the official Obsidian Community Plugins directory.

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins** and turn off **Restricted mode** if it is enabled.
2. Click **Browse** and search for `Termy`.
3. Click **Install**, then **Enable**.

### Install with BRAT (early updates)

Use BRAT if you want to track the latest tagged build before it ships to the community directory.

1. Install [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).
2. Open BRAT settings and choose **Add beta plugin**.
3. Enter `ZyphrZero/Termy`.
4. Install the plugin and enable it in **Settings → Community plugins**.

### Manual install

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZyphrZero/Termy/releases).
2. Extract the release files into `.obsidian/plugins/termy/` inside your vault.
3. Reload Obsidian.
4. Enable Termy in **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Quick Start

1. Open Termy from the ribbon, command palette, empty-tab action, or status bar.
2. Choose your shell and terminal placement behavior in settings.
3. Try the built-in workflows from the status bar menu.
4. Send your current selection, note, or file path into the terminal.
5. Drag a file or folder into the terminal to paste its resolved path.
6. Click file references printed by tools or agents to jump back into the matching file.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm build:rust
pnpm package:zip
```

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Frontend build/watch flow. |
| `pnpm build` | TypeScript check, production bundle, and bundle smoke check. |
| `pnpm build:rust` | Build native PTY backend binaries. |
| `pnpm package:zip` | Create a release zip. |
| `pnpm install:dev <vault-path>` | Build everything and install into a local dev vault. Pass `--no-rust` to skip the native PTY rebuild when only TypeScript changed. |
| `pnpm test:terminal` | Compile and run terminal-layer Node tests. |

## Architecture

```

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Obsidian plugin APIs, and xterm.js.
- **Backend**: Native Rust PTY server built on `portable-pty`.
- **AI context**: Claude Code and OpenCode integrate through the IDE bridge; Codex integrates through a vault-local Skill.
- **Packaging**: Generated plugin assets are emitted as `main.js` and `styles.css`; the native server is distributed separately as an external `termy-server` CLI.
