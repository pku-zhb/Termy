# Changelog

All notable changes to Termy will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.9] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Added a command-palette action for showing or hiding the Codex activity overlay.
- Added Kitty graphics direct-PNG compatibility for Codex Pets while retaining Sixel support.

### Changed
- Let the Codex activity overlay remain visible while scrolling and grow with its content up to the full terminal height instead of half the screen.
- Show a separate completion row after Codex finishes without copying the final answer into the overlay.
- Classify Codex quota windows by their reported duration and show the currently available weekly quota without a misleading five-hour meter.

### Fixed
- Positioned Sixel and Kitty image layers inside the xterm canvas stack so terminal images remain visible with transparent backgrounds.

## [1.5.8] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Clean up the complete PTY process session when a terminal is destroyed, including Codex and other interactive children that move into separate process groups.
- Bound PTY registry locks, session teardown, and reader-task shutdown so an orphaned backend cannot wait forever during cleanup.
- Force an obsolete backend to exit after a bounded cleanup window when its Obsidian parent disappears, and remove only its own temporary server registry entry.

## [1.5.7] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Added a Codex activity overlay that shows the current prompt and public progress or reasoning summaries while leaving tool output and the final answer in the terminal transcript.
- Added Sixel image support through the xterm image addon, including terminal capability reporting and a bounded image cache.

### Changed
- Rendered Codex activity with Obsidian's Markdown engine and theme typography, with a two-line prompt area and a progress area that grows with content up to half the terminal height.
- Show the activity overlay only when the terminal has scrollback and is at the bottom; scrolling upward hides it, while new progress stays pinned to the latest update.
- Replaced the agent monitor's manual refresh and expandable session-details controls with a persistent Codex activity toggle.

### Fixed
- Fixed Codex sessions remaining green after a turn completed by honoring canonical turn lifecycle events and preventing stale running hooks from overriding runtime completion.
- Ignored persistent `codex-code-mode-host` companion processes when deciding whether Codex still has active background work.

## [1.5.6] - 2026-07-07

### Changed
- Map Termy's Obsidian-derived ANSI palette to a minimal two-accent scheme: cyan and bright cyan use the theme secondary seed, while the remaining colored ANSI slots use the primary seed. Neutral black/white slots stay derived from the foreground/background for readability.

### Fixed
- Clear inherited `NO_COLOR` values before launching the Termy server and PTY shells so Codex and other TUIs can emit color normally inside Obsidian.
- Reply to OSC 10/11 default foreground/background color queries using the active terminal theme, allowing Codex to choose light/dark diff rendering from the real Obsidian theme.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Clickable bare file paths in terminal output: vault-file paths printed without a `file://` prefix — absolute, `$HOME`-relative, or vault-relative, with an optional `:line` suffix — are now linkified and open in Obsidian at the cited line. This covers agents (e.g. Codex) whose renderer collapses a Markdown link into a plain `$HOME`-relative path, which previously was not clickable.
- Resolution is validated against the in-memory vault index, which both disambiguates space-containing paths and gates linkification to real vault files so arbitrary paths in ordinary terminal output (ls, build logs) are not underlined.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- Added local agent tab auto-restore for Claude Code and Codex tabs, including delayed resume after the terminal becomes ready.
- Added macOS notifications for local agent status changes.

### Fixed
- Fixed restored Codex tabs reusing stale session metadata across multiple terminal tabs.
- Fixed Codex restore commands to pass the saved workspace with `--cd`, so resumed sessions start in the original working directory.
- Fixed long Chinese IME and voice-input preedit text so it wraps within the terminal instead of pushing the viewport horizontally.
- Made the IME preedit overlay transparent so it no longer covers previously typed terminal content.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Added hook-first agent status detection for Claude Code and Codex using machine-local Termy hook state, with the previous process/session/log scanners kept as fallbacks.
- Added coverage for fresh hook state overriding stale Claude session freshness and Codex sqlite scans.

### Fixed
- Fixed split Claude `file://` links with encoded spaces not being rejoined across wrapped terminal rows.
- Fixed terminal hyperlink providers being disposed across tabs by tracking a separate provider for each terminal instance.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- Merged the reconnect/session-preservation work into the 1.5.1 agent monitor line so the fork can ship from a single master branch.

### Fixed
- Preserved terminal sessions across backend reconnects instead of tearing them down on WebSocket disconnect.
- Refocused the active terminal after switching back to a Termy leaf.
- Cleaned up superseded PTY server processes after a newer server takes over.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Added a compact in-plugin agent monitor for Claude Code and Codex, including usage/reset meters derived from the active Obsidian theme.
- Added terminal-tab status styling for Claude, Codex, tmux, running, and approval-needed states, including nested agent indicators for tmux panes.

### Fixed
- Fixed tmux-hosted Claude/Codex sessions not being matched back to the active Termy tab.
- Fixed idle Codex sessions being shown as running because persistent helper processes were counted as active work.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Configurable keyboard routing: Opt-shortcuts go to Termy, Cmd-shortcuts to Obsidian, Ctrl-chords to the running program (with a blacklist), all adjustable via a JSON rule list in settings.
- Clickable `file://` links in terminal output. Links to vault files open inside Obsidian (with `#L12`-style line anchors); other paths open with the system default. Works with raw spaces, percent-encoding, and CJK filenames.
- Full support for links hard-wrapped by TUI frameworks (Claude Code, Codex, tmux): wrapped lines are re-joined semantically, word-wrap-eaten spaces are recovered via click-time fallback candidates, adjacent links never merge, and hovering any row highlights the whole link with precise per-row underlines.
- Backend card in settings: shows termy-server status and Homebrew install/upgrade guidance.
- Closing the last terminal tab now respawns a fresh terminal instead of closing the whole view.

### Fixed
- IME composition preview (pinyin and other preedit input) was invisible inside the terminal; composing text now renders with proper colors over the canvas.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Fixed Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V not firing on consecutive presses while Ctrl was still held in PowerShell and other shells using win32 input mode. The same shortcut-suppression rule that previously broke repeat Shift+Enter newlines now keeps the trailing keyup of the chord suppressed but lets a fresh Ctrl+C or Ctrl+V keydown trigger another copy or paste.
- Fixed Termy's right-click menu stealing Claude Code's "right-click to paste" gesture. Active Claude Code TUI sessions now suppress the Termy menu so Claude Code's own paste fires once instead of being doubled by an extra Termy paste; other shells keep the Termy context menu, and Shift+RightClick always opens the Termy menu as an escape hatch.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Mapped each Termy version to the minimum Obsidian version it supports so the in-app updater only offers builds that match your installation.

### Changed
- Raised the minimum Obsidian version to 1.8.7 and refreshed the plugin description to match what Termy actually does today.
- Tuned terminal appearance handling so font, theme, and renderer changes apply to every open terminal the moment you save settings, and custom background colors and images now show through reliably across the canvas, WebGL, and DOM renderers.
- Reworked home-directory resolution so paths like `~/Documents` expand correctly on every platform, including profiles where the usual environment variables are not set.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Added a terminal context-menu action for switching the default shell straight from an open terminal.

### Changed
- Refreshed the README version badges and the project positioning copy.

### Fixed
- Fixed the "open in file manager" action opening the parent folder after `cd <subdir>`, so cmd, PowerShell, Git Bash, and WSL terminals now open the actual current folder.
- Fixed always-on-top terminals: the pinned window now stays scoped to its own terminal, new terminals open with the normal layout, and the pinned session can be returned to the main window without restarting.
- Fixed missing lock indicators on always-on-top terminal tabs and in the terminal right-click menu.
- Fixed Claude Code terminal titles being lost after a session, and cleared stale Claude Code drag references between sessions.
- Fixed terminal context menus drifting off-screen near the edge of the pane.
- Fixed missing translations on terminal notices, and corrected the Windows shell label to `CMD`.
- Fixed preset workflow pins not staying put, and reduced reconnect churn while the plugin reinstalls in development vaults.

### Removed
- Removed the automatic plugin disable / re-enable used by the settings reload button and the development install watcher. Reloading Termy now goes through Obsidian's normal plugin settings, in line with Obsidian's developer policy.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- Fixed newline insertion (Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter, Alt+Enter) not working in Codex CLI sessions running under WSL2. The modifier+Enter combinations now bypass win32-input-mode encoding and send a real newline through the bracketed paste path so TUI programs correctly interpret it as a multiline edit.
- Fixed inability to insert consecutive newlines by holding Shift and pressing Enter repeatedly. The win32 shortcut suppression flag is no longer set for newline operations, allowing key-repeat to work as expected.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Added developer scrollback reproduction scripts for comparing synchronized redraw behavior across terminals and validating Termy's compatibility layer.

### Changed
- Split generic AI TUI synchronized-output compatibility helpers out of the Claude Code support module so terminal protocol boundaries are clearer.

### Fixed
- Preserved terminal scrollback more reliably for AI TUIs that redraw on the normal buffer in xterm.js hosts, including synchronized-output redraw flows that previously purged history in Termy.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added a local Obsidian review lint command so community-review checks can run before publishing.

### Changed
- Updated English UI copy and README disclosures to align with Obsidian community review requirements.
- Upgraded Node type definitions to Node 20 and adjusted byte handling for stricter Buffer typing.

### Fixed
- Prevented redundant agent context snapshot writes when the active Obsidian context has not changed.
- Hardened IDE bridge message decoding and binary checksum hashing to use explicit byte handling.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Added OpenCode as a built-in workflow launcher with a dedicated icon and context-aware integration settings.
- Added OpenCode context handoff through Termy's IDE bridge so OpenCode sessions launched from Termy can inherit the active Obsidian workspace context.
- Added development auto-reload support so `pnpm install:dev <vault-path>` can refresh the running Termy plugin after copying updated assets.

### Changed
- Changed Codex context awareness to use a Termy-managed vault-local Skill while the built-in launcher starts `codex` directly.
- Kept Claude Code and OpenCode on the IDE bridge path while documenting Codex as the Skill-based integration.
- Normalized built-in workflow definitions from current defaults so saved built-ins pick up refreshed launcher commands and icons.

### Removed
- Removed Codex MCP auto-registration, global CLI configuration mutation, and the old launch-prompt context handoff path.
- Removed the legacy context instructions file path in favor of the single live context snapshot consumed by the Codex Skill.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Added selectable installed terminal shell programs, such as `tmux`, in terminal settings while keeping custom shell paths supported.
- Added Claude Code-aware file and folder drops that insert working-directory-relative `@path` references with safe quoting, directory trailing slashes, and trailing spacing.
- Added support for literal `file://` links in terminal output, complementing OSC 8 hyperlinks from Claude Code and other CLIs.
- Added Telegram community links in settings, README files, and generated release notes.

### Changed
- Improved Claude Code TUI compatibility by advertising Termy as an xterm.js host and handling terminal capability, extended keyboard, and OSC 52 clipboard flows expected by Claude Code.
- Improved release-note generation so generated notes use the correct changelog header format and include refreshed support links.

### Fixed
- Fixed WebSocket reconnect recovery so each open terminal recreates and rebinds its PTY session after reconnect, restoring keyboard input instead of leaving the pane attached to a stale session.
- Fixed Claude Code file hyperlinks and literal file URI output so matching files open inside Obsidian when possible.
- Fixed Claude Code drag-and-drop paths from Obsidian URIs with encoded separators and ampersands, and prevented basename-only folder drops from losing full path context.
- Fixed Windows Codex prompt redraw corruption by preventing duplicate IME/input events in Windows input mode.
- Fixed shell selection detection in Obsidian's renderer process and filtered GUI terminal apps out of the shell launcher list.
- Fixed local development install copying so plugin installs are more reliable when refreshing generated assets and native binaries.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-23

This section covers the combined changes shipped in versions `1.3.0-1.3.1`.

### Added
- Added terminal keyboard handling for multi-line `Shift+Enter`, using text insertion by default and Windows `win32-input-mode` when requested by the shell.
- Added Windows `win32-input-mode` keyboard encoding for printable keys, modifiers, navigation keys, function keys, lock-key state, and key release events.
- Added command palette actions to send the current editor selection, note content, or file path into the active terminal.
- Added clickable file references in terminal output so agent responses can open matching files directly from Obsidian.
- Added Claude Code context awareness so sessions launched from Termy can read the active Obsidian file and selection.
- Added Codex CLI context integration with optional auto-registration for the bundled `termy-context` MCP server.
- Added a server settings control to switch native binary downloads between GitHub Release and the built-in Cloudflare R2 mirror, plus a manual binary download trigger for on-demand checks and recovery.

### Changed
- Improved Windows terminal keyboard routing so PowerShell and other ConPTY-aware shells can opt into Win32 key event input instead of relying only on xterm-style input sequences.
- Reworked preset scripts into preset workflows with configurable action lists, including terminal commands, Obsidian command search, and external link actions.
- Standardized internal source comments to English across the TypeScript, CSS, and Rust codebases for easier maintenance.
- Streamlined agent handoffs by routing send and paste flows through terminal-owned APIs and focusing the receiving terminal after handoff.
- Expanded preset workflow controls with per-action enable toggles, notes, and built-in Claude Code and Codex CLI integration settings.
- Bundled the changelog into the plugin build so release notes can open reliably across BRAT and packaged installs, and moved the changelog shortcut beside the Termy title in settings.
- Added a dedicated Cloudflare R2 upload script and release workflow step so published binary artifacts are mirrored outside GitHub Releases.

### Fixed
- Merged community fix from [#3](https://github.com/ZyphrZero/Termy/pull/3) to bump the esbuild target to ES2021, preserving xterm's `requestMode()` handling and preventing TUI sessions such as Claude Code from freezing on DECRQM output, and added a bundle smoke check to catch regressions before packaging.
- Fixed a Windows keyboard handling crash while reading modifier and lock-key state for `win32-input-mode` events.
- Improved terminal drag-and-drop handling so dropped text and file paths resolve more reliably for agent and workflow launches.
- Fixed nested vault folder drags that could collapse into basename-only text such as `15040` instead of inserting the full absolute path into the terminal.
- Fixed same-name folder drags on Windows so dropped directories no longer resolve to folder-note markdown files instead of the dropped directory path.
- Updated the TypeScript project configuration away from deprecated compiler options and expanded binary download diagnostics to make update failures easier to troubleshoot.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Added a localized drag hint key for terminal drag-to-paste interactions.
- Added a custom Termy SVG ribbon icon for opening the terminal view.

### Changed
- Updated terminal drag hint copy to a consistent message: "Drag to paste file path".
- Expanded drop payload parsing to support file entries, URI payloads, Obsidian links, and vault-relative paths.
- Updated command and ribbon labels from "Open terminal" to "Open Termy terminal".
- Improved drag hint overlay transitions for clearer visual feedback.

### Fixed
- Improved dropped file absolute path resolution on desktop via Electron `webUtils`.
- Refined drag enter/leave depth tracking to prevent stale overlay visibility during nested drag events.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Added emoji support for preset script icons, rendered consistently across the picker, list, and status bar menu.
- Added Japanese (`ja`), Korean (`ko`), and Russian (`ru`) translations.

### Changed
- Converted English UI strings to sentence case for settings, menus, and commands.
- Replaced `Obsidian Termy` with `Termy` in UI strings and theme preview text.
- Applied theme preview and terminal appearance via element CSS variables instead of injected style tags.
- Replaced native confirm with an Obsidian modal for preset script deletion.
- Localized debug settings labels and notices.
- Updated preset script icon placeholder text to mention emoji support.
- Updated locale detection to follow the Obsidian language with base-language fallback.

### Fixed
- Switched active view lookup to `getActiveViewOfType` to avoid `activeLeaf` deprecation.
- Marked background promises as handled/voided to satisfy lint rules.
- Removed redundant assertions in preset script actions and PTY shell events.
- Updated debug logging to `console.debug` to meet console restrictions.
- Added explicit error handling when opening external links and file paths from terminal output.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- Tracked renderer type explicitly to avoid WebGL misreporting after bundling/minification.
- Added automatic fallback to Canvas on WebGL context loss with reliable state updates.
- Validated WebGL2 support to align with xterm WebGL addon requirements.

### Changed
- Replaced inline style writes with scoped style rules for terminal appearance and theme preview.
- Resolved plugin directory using `vault.configDir` instead of hard-coded `.obsidian`.
- Deferred UI setup to `workspace.onLayoutReady` for safer startup timing.
- Optimized preset script icon loading with explicit named imports to improve tree-shaking and runtime lookup.

### Removed

- Added a new `pwsh` option to the shell dropdown in terminal settings.
- Added automatic fallback from `pwsh` to PowerShell 5.x when PowerShell 7 is not installed.
- Added diagnostic logging for shell detection and selection.
- Added i18n translations for the PowerShell 7 option in English and Chinese.

### Changed
